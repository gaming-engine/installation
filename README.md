# Gaming Engine

Have you ever wanted to make your own Browser-Based game? Have you started the process, only to find out how expensive
developers are to build features for your site that are required but not special for your game? Read more about Gaming
Engine [here](https://gamingengine.dev).

# Gaming Engine - Installer

This package is a one time use package to help with the initial installation of the Gaming Engine.  During this installation
process, you will:

1. Verify your PHP installation (ensuring you have all the necessary requirements)
2. Set the default language for your site
3. Set up the initial database connection
4. Create your first account (i.e. administrator).

Once this process is complete, this package will become unavailable in order to protect your site from possible bad actors 
who know you are using Gaming Engine and try to clear your information.  At that point, you are safe to completely uninstall
it.

## Testing

Making sure that the framework is working as anticipated is one of our main focuses. Because of this, we will do our
best to make sure that the code is of the best quality possible. Because of that, the commitment to you, the user of it
will be 95% test coverage of any features that are built into it (for all parts of the framework and not just this
component). We will run all tests on MySQL, PostgresSQL and SQLite databases to ensure maximum flexibility.

To run tests, you can run the following command:

```bash
composer test
```
